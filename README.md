<h1>Here's the code for my personal homepage!</h1>

## What Worked

I managed to come away from this with a resume and bio page that I am pretty proud of. I learned that implementing the HTML is fairly straight-forward, but finding the right styling takes time.

## What Flopped

My homepage is rather clunky. Moving forward, I think I would like to divide the webpage into two vertical columns occupied by the photo and text, respectively. I would also like to add some more interactive elements so users can better navigate my page. Mobile optimization also certainly needs improvement.

## Collaboration

I would like to thank <a href="http://www.davidbarsky.com/">David Barsky</a>, who always makes himself avaliable to bounce ideas off of and who can always point me in the right direction. His enthusiasm for programming is what got me here and has me sticking around.

## Time Spent

So far, this project has taken me about a half day. The majority of the time was spent styling.
